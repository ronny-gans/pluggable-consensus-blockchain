# Pluggable Consensus Blockchain v0.1.0
A modular blockchain written in Rust with pluggable consensus mechanisms (currently supporting Proof of Work and Proof of Authority).

## Features
- Add user that consist of username, password, public key, private key, salt, nonce, balance, and boolean validator. The public key, private key, salt, and nonce is generated based on username and password
- show all user
- add transaction, consist of:
  - send token
  - show all blocks
  - save blocks to file
 
 ## Key features 
 The blockchain is using pluggable consensus mechanisms, currently supporting proof of work and proof of authority. The use of these mechanisms currently is based on the total transaction in a block. If the total transaction in a block > 1000, the consensus mechanism use Proof of Work, if the total transaction in a block <= 1000 the mining and validating mechanism use proof of authority.

 ## Key Technology Usage
 - Rust
 - ed25519_dalek
 - Argon2
 - Sha2, hex
 - aes_gcm
